Welcome to the official website for createbits! In the next few weeks I'll start uploading
videos to various online sites such as vidme, Youtube and more. I hope createbits grows into a community of creatives and the ones who want to get there. This is
my first personal project where I conciously steer the project through a clear vision, which is: __Embracing
and nurturing your creativity__. 

Feel free to send me a [mail](/contact) or check out the [vidme](https://vid.me/createbits) channel to see what the heck
I'm writing about. I don't have any concrete monetization plan but I'm nevertheless grateful 
if you support createbits in any way. I'm really looking forward to your reactions and hope these videos and mini-projects will be helpful to you.
